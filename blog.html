        <h2>✨ Understanding Your Birth Chart</h2>
        <p>
          Your birth chart, also known as a natal chart, is a cosmic map of the sky at the exact moment you were born. It reveals your personality, emotions, strengths, weaknesses, and life purpose.
          Each planet influences different aspects of your life. The Sun defines your ego and identity, the Moon reflects your emotions, and your Ascendant determines how the world perceives you.

        <h2>💖 How Astrology Shapes Relationships</h2>
        <p>
          Astrological compatibility helps you understand how two individuals connect emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. Sun signs give a broad idea, but true compatibility lies in Moon signs, Venus positions, and house placements.
          This deeper insight allows couples to communicate better, resolve conflicts, and build long-lasting harmony.
